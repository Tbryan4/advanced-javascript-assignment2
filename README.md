## WEBSITE CONTENT

Shoe Locker aims to

- Allow Authenticated users to sign into the website
- Have a clean UI/UX Design 
- Present the user with a dashboard of basketball shoes
- Add new Unique products to the dashboard
- Edit products that are currently in the dashboard with new data points
- Delete products that the user does not want in their dashboard
- Throw a customized 404 Page error if the user tries to enter an invalid page **OR** tries to bypass the sign in page

## 404

Some pages in the sidebar will return a 404 error, this is intentional because I intend to allow access to these pages when the website is actually finished

The pages that will show a 404 error is the 

- User Page,
- Order Page,
- Review Page
